Pomodoro-Timer
==============

A nice graphical timer for your Pomodoro workflow.

Visit http://pomodoro-timer.org to see it in action!

The timer uses an HTML5 Canvas to draw the tomato. It runs entirely in client-side JavaScript. All past achievements are saved using localStorage. Thus, they are not portable across devices or browsers, sorry.

The timer is licensed under the GPL license.
